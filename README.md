TR23.TrueFX is a demonstration project I wrote for my upcoming "Batch Processing in Azure" presentation at Microsoft's internal TechReady23 conference.  The project is meant to demonstrate a number of real-world WebJobs features, including:

 - AmbientConnectionStringProvider
 - WebJob configuration
 - Working with TimerTriggers
 - Working with QueueTriggers 
 - Working with Queues
 - Working with CloudBlobContainers
 - Custom error-handling
 - Work decomposition
 - Sending email alerts via SendGrid
 - Dev vs. Prod Initialization
 - Graceful shutdown
 - Error aggregation via ErrorTrigger

To run the demo, you'll need to you'll need to sign up for a free SendGrid account (at [https://sendgrid.com/pricing/](https://sendgrid.com/pricing/)) then create an API Key.  Also, replace the AzureWebJobsSendGridApiKey, AlertsFrom, AlertsTo, AzureWebJobsDashboard and AzureWebJobsStorage placeholders in the App.config file with appropriate values.
